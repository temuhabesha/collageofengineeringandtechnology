              College of Engineering and Technology has been newly established
              in 2022 having seven departments: Civil Engineering, Computer
              Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hydraulics and Water
              Resource Engineering, Information System, Information Technology,
              and Software Engineering. In addition to the undergraduate
              programs, the college is working hard to launch postgraduate
              programs. Currently, the college has 29 academic staff including
              two PhD holders. There are also eight Technical Assistants in the
              college.

            <p>
              The college has a total of 1314 undergraduate students in
              different modalities. Among this number, 473 students are in

              The college has a mission of producing competent graduates with
              skill, attitude, and discipline; delivering need−based and
              demand−driven community services; and conducting problem solving
              research. It envisions to be one of the best preferred Engineering
              and Technology Colleges from the top three compressive
              universities in Ethiopia by 2030.
