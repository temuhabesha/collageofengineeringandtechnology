              College of Engineering and Technology has been newly established
              in 2022 having seven departments: Civil Engineering, Computer
              Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hydraulics and Water
              Resource Engineering, Information System, Information Technology,
              and Software Engineering. In addition to the undergraduate
              programs, the college is working hard to launch postgraduate
              programs. Currently, the college has 29 academic staff including
              two PhD holders. There are also eight Technical Assistants in the
              college.
